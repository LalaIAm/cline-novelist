/**
 * Character Development Assistance Prototype
 * 
 * This prototype demonstrates an AI-powered character development assistant
 * that leverages the context handling techniques developed for
 * writing continuation to provide deeper character insights and development suggestions.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Uses character profile and story context for informed suggestions
 * - Incorporates semantic search for finding relevant character moments across the manuscript
 * - Implements caching for improved performance
 * - Leverages the same context handling approach proven successful for writing continuation

${developmentRequest}

Please provide detailed, thoughtful character development suggestions. 
Include psychological insights, potential character arcs, and specific scenes or moments that could reveal character depth. 
Offer ideas that maintain consistency with the existing character while adding nuance and complexity.

Your response should include:
1. Character Psychology: Deeper insights into the character's mind and motivations
2. Background Development: Suggestions for backstory elements that inform their current behavior
3. Arc Development: Potential growth trajectories and transformative moments
4. Scene Suggestions: Specific scenarios that could showcase character depth
5. Relationship Dynamics: How their interactions with other characters could evolve`;
