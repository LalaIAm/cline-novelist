Michael Chen,\" he replied. \"And you?\"\n\n\"Sophia Rodriguez.\" She extended her hand. \"Nice to meet you.\"\n\nHe shook her hand, holding it a moment longer than necessary. \"So, Sophia, what brings you to Jen's wedding?\"\n\n\"College roommate. You?\"\n\n\"The groom is my cousin.\" Michael looked at his plate. \"Small world.\"\n\n\"It is,\" she agreed, then hesitated. \"Wait... Chen. You don't happen to work at Meridian Partners, do you?\"\n\nMichael's smile faded slightly. \"I do, actually. I'm their lead architect on the Westlake project.\"\n\n\"No way,\" Sophia said, putting down her glass. \"I'm the design director at Innovations Group.\"\n\n\"The competing bid,\" Michael stated flatly.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, this is awkward,\" he said, forcing a smile.\n\n\"Very,\" she replied.",

I want to enhance it to better show their instant attraction while maintaining the tension of discovering they're competitors. I'd like to add more subtext, personality-specific speech patterns, and physical reactions/micro-expressions during their conversation. The dialogue should hint at their core values and create a memorable 'meet-cute' that sets up their relationship arc. Please rewrite this dialogue to be more dynamic while keeping the same basic information exchange.",
