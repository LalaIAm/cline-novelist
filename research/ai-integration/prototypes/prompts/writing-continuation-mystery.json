  "recentText": "Detective Morgan surveyed the hotel room with narrowed eyes, taking in every detail â€“ the unmade bed, the half-empty glass of whiskey, and the open window with curtains fluttering in the night breeze. Something didn't add up. The victim's belongings were untouched, yet the safe stood open and empty.\n\n'Time of death?' she asked, turning to Dr. Rivera, who knelt beside the body.\n\nThe medical examiner looked up, snapping off his latex gloves. 'Between 10 PM and midnight, based on liver temperature and rigor. But there's something strange about the wound pattern.'\n\n'Strange how?' Morgan moved closer, crouching beside him.\n\n'The angle is inconsistent with a right-handed assailant attacking from the front. And look at this,' he pointed to a small puncture mark on the victim's neck. 'This wasn't caused by the same weapon as the chest wound.'",
