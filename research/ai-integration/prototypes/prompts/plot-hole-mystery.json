  "plotHoleIssue": "While reviewing my draft, I realized there's a timing issue with the alibis. I've established that Thomas Harrington was at a charity gala until 1AM with multiple witnesses, but I also want him to be the killer who staged the security system glitch to create an opportunity to access files after the murder. Marcus Reed is supposed to be the actual murderer who acted in anger, but I've written that he was caught on camera entering his apartment building at 10PM and not leaving until morning. The building's security 'glitch' conveniently covers the murder timeframe, but I haven't explained how either suspect could have committed the crime given their alibis.",
  "authorRequest": "Please identify the plot holes in my mystery setup regarding timeline and alibis. Then suggest solutions that would allow my intended scenario to work (Thomas orchestrating but not committing the murder, with Marcus as the actual killer) while maintaining the mystery elements and without introducing new major characters. Consider how they might have coordinated, created fake alibis, or manipulated evidence."
