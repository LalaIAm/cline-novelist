  "genre": "fantasy",
  "characterName": "Kael Stormwind",
  "characterConcept": "A reluctant mage who fears his own growing powers",
  "currentDescription": "Kael is a 28-year-old former soldier who discovered his magical abilities late in life. He has raven-black hair, piercing blue eyes, and a scar running down his left cheek from a battle wound. He wears simple clothing and tries to blend into crowds, avoiding attention. He carries a staff that he pretends is just for walking, but actually helps him channel his unpredictable magic. Kael is quiet, observant, and distrustful of authority.",
  "worldContext": "In this world, magic users are registered and controlled by the Imperial Arcanum. Unregistered mages are hunted by specialized trackers called Spellbreakers. Magic manifests differently in each user, influenced by their personality and experiences.",
  "storyRole": "Kael is a supporting character who reluctantly becomes involved in the protagonist's quest after she helps him escape from Spellbreakers. His attitude toward magic will evolve throughout the story.",
  "characterGoals": "Kael wants to learn to control his powers without submitting to the Arcanum's authority. He is searching for a legendary hermit mage who is rumored to teach control without registration.",
  "characterFlaws": "Paranoia, stubbornness, and a tendency to push away people who try to help him. He often sabotages his own chances at happiness out of fear.",
  "authorNotes": "I want Kael to have more depth and complexity. His fear of his own power is central to his character, but I'm not sure how to develop his arc beyond that initial concept. I want him to grow throughout the story without making his transformation feel too sudden or unearned.",
  "developmentRequest": "Please suggest ways to deepen Kael's character, including potential background elements, internal conflicts, relationships that could shape his growth, and meaningful moments that could mark his character development arc. I'm particularly interested in exploring how his fear of his own power might manifest in specific situations."
