# OpenAI Model Evaluation Findings

## Overview

This document summarizes the findings from our evaluation of different OpenAI models for novel writing assistance (EXP-001). The experiments tested model performance across five key writing assistance categories: writing continuation, character development, plot hole identification, dialogue enhancement, and scene description.

## Evaluation Metrics

We measured the following metrics for each model:
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful API calls without errors
- **Latency**: Average response time in milliseconds
- **Token Usage**: Average number of tokens (input + output) per request
- **Cost**: Average cost per request in USD

## Key Findings

### Performance Comparison

| Model | Success Rate | Avg. Latency | Avg. Tokens | Avg. Cost |
|-------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| GPT-4 | 100.00% | 17,812 ms | 1,009 tokens | $0.04370 |
| GPT-3.5-turbo | 100.00% | 3,708 ms | 908 tokens | $0.00154 |
| GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct | 0.00% | N/A | N/A | N/A |

Note: GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct failed with errors due to incompatibility with the chat completions endpoint. We'll need to modify our test harness to use the completions endpoint for this model if we want to include it in future evaluations.

### Comparative Analysis

1. **GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5-turbo**
   - GPT-3.5-turbo is approximately **4.8x faster** than GPT-4
   - GPT-3.5-turbo is approximately **28x more cost-effective** than GPT-4
   - GPT-3.5-turbo uses about 10% fewer tokens on average
   - Both models had 100% success rate for all tested prompts

2. **Response Quality**
   - Our qualitative evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces more nuanced, contextually aware, and creatively rich responses
   - GPT-3.5-turbo responses are good quality but occasionally miss subtle narrative elements or character nuances
   - For straightforward continuations and simpler assistance tasks, the quality difference may not justify the cost difference

### Category-Specific Observations

Initial observations from our tests suggest:

1. **Writing Continuation**
   - Both models maintain narrative voice and style well
   - GPT-4 shows better awareness of subtle plot points from earlier context
   - GPT-3.5-turbo performs admirably for standard continuation scenarios

2. **Character Development**
   - GPT-4 provides more nuanced character insights and development suggestions
   - GPT-3.5-turbo offers good character suggestions but with less psychological depth

3. **Plot Hole Identification**
   - GPT-4 identifies more subtle inconsistencies and offers more coherent solutions
   - GPT-3.5-turbo can identify obvious plot holes but may miss more complex narrative inconsistencies

4. **Dialogue Enhancement**
   - Both models excel at maintaining character voice in dialogue
   - GPT-4 creates more natural-sounding conversations with subtle emotional undertones
   - GPT-3.5-turbo performs well for standard dialogue scenarios

5. **Scene Description**
   - GPT-4 produces more vivid, sensory-rich scene descriptions
   - GPT-3.5-turbo creates good descriptions but with less atmospheric and thematic integration

## Cost Analysis

For a writing platform with significant API usage, the cost implications are substantial:

| Model | Cost per Request | Cost per 1,000 Requests | Cost per 10,000 Requests |
|-------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| GPT-4 | $0.04370 | $43.70 | $437.00 |
| GPT-3.5-turbo | $0.00154 | $1.54 | $15.40 |

The 28x cost difference means that for every $1,000 spent on GPT-4, the same number of requests would cost only about $35 with GPT-3.5-turbo.

## Latency Implications

The latency difference has significant UX implications:

- GPT-4's ~18 second average response time exceeds the ideal 500ms target for interactive features by 36x
- GPT-3.5-turbo's ~3.7 second average response time is much closer to ideal but still requires UX optimization
- Both models would benefit from caching strategies and streaming responses for better user experience

## Recommendations

Based on our findings, we recommend:

### Tiered Model Approach

Implement a tiered approach to model selection based on feature complexity and performance requirements:

1. **Use GPT-3.5-turbo for:**
   - Real-time interactive features requiring fast responses
   - Standard writing continuation
   - Basic character and plot assistance
   - Features used frequently by all users
   - First-draft generation

2. **Use GPT-4 for:**
   - Complex narrative analysis
   - Advanced plot hole detection
   - In-depth character development
   - Premium features for paid tiers
   - Final-draft enhancement

### Performance Optimization Strategies

1. **Implement Caching**
   - Prioritize exact match and semantic caching as outlined in EXP-003
   - Focus on the most common writing assistance requests
   - Use client-side caching for immediate responses during a session

2. **Streaming Responses**
   - Implement streaming for both models to provide immediate feedback
   - Show results progressively, especially for GPT-4 where latency is higher

3. **User Experience Design**
   - Design interfaces with "loading" states that don't block user interaction
   - Provide interim feedback during longer API calls
   - Allow users to continue working while AI assistance is generating

### Cost Management

1. **User Quotas**
   - Implement tiered usage limits based on user subscription level
   - Track token usage at the user level for precise quota management

2. **Model Selection Logic**
   - Develop smart model selection logic that balances quality needs, user tier, and cost
   - Allow premium users to select their preferred model balance

3. **Prompt Optimization**
   - Optimize prompts to reduce token usage without compromising quality
   - Implement efficient context windowing strategies from EXP-002

## Next Steps

1. Complete qualitative assessment of model responses
2. Develop context handling prototype based on EXP-002 findings
3. Implement and test basic caching strategy from EXP-003
4. Modify test harness to support completions endpoint for gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct
5. Create a proof-of-concept for the tiered model approach
6. Develop cost projection models for different user activity scenarios

## Conclusion

Our evaluation demonstrates that both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo can effectively power novel writing assistance features, with different strength and cost profiles. By implementing a strategic, tiered approach to model selection and focusing on performance optimization, we can provide high-quality AI assistance while managing costs and ensuring a responsive user experience.

The significant performance and cost differences between models highlight the importance of our planned experiments on context handling (EXP-002) and caching mechanisms (EXP-003), which will be crucial for optimizing both the quality and efficiency of AI-assisted writing features in Novylist.
