# Context Handling Strategies for Long-Form Novel Content

## Metadata
- **Experiment ID**: EXP-002
- **Date**: 4/13/2025
- **Researcher**: Novylist Team
- **Category**: Context Management
- **Status**: Planned

## Objective
To evaluate and compare different context handling strategies for long-form novel content, determining the most effective approaches for maintaining narrative coherence and context awareness across large documents that exceed token limits of AI models.

## Background
Novel writing typically involves documents that are far longer than the context window of even the most advanced AI models (e.g., 100,000+ words for novels vs. 8K-32K token windows). Effective AI assistance for novel writing requires strategies to handle these limitations while maintaining a coherent understanding of the narrative. This experiment will evaluate different approaches to context windowing, summarization, and hybrid strategies.

## Hypothesis
A hybrid approach combining sliding windows with strategic summarization and metadata will provide the best balance of context awareness and performance for AI assistance in novel writing.

## Methodology

### Environment Setup
- Node.js test environment using the selected OpenAI model from EXP-001
- Sample novel content of various lengths (10K, 50K, 100K words)
- Benchmark tasks requiring different levels of context awareness
- Performance measurement framework for latency, token usage, and quality

### Context Handling Strategies to Test

1. **Simple Sliding Window**
   - Use the most recent N tokens as context
   - Pros: Simple implementation, consistent token usage
   - Cons: Limited awareness of earlier content

2. **Hierarchical Summarization**
   - Maintain nested levels of summaries (chapter, section, paragraph)
   - Include relevant summaries + immediate context in prompts
   - Pros: Better long-range awareness
   - Cons: Complexity, quality dependent on summaries

3. **Key Information Extraction**
   - Extract and maintain key narrative elements (characters, plot points, settings)
   - Include relevant elements + immediate context
   - Pros: Focus on most relevant information
   - Cons: May miss nuanced connections

4. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Combine immediate context with summaries and key information
   - Dynamically adjust based on query needs
   - Pros: Flexible, potentially better quality
   - Cons: Implementation complexity, variable token usage

5. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - Index entire novel content for semantic retrieval
   - Retrieve relevant passages based on similarity to current task
   - Pros: Potentially better for specific references
   - Cons: Requires additional infrastructure, potential latency

### Benchmark Tasks

For each strategy, we'll evaluate performance on:

1. **Continuation Tasks**
   - Continue the narrative with awareness of earlier plot points
   - Assess coherence and consistency with previous content

2. **Consistency Checks**
   - Identify inconsistencies with earlier content
   - Test awareness of character traits, plot elements established earlier

3. **Reference Resolution**
   - Answer questions about specific earlier content
   - Test ability to find and use information from distant parts of text

4. **Thematic Development**
   - Suggest developments that align with established themes
   - Test understanding of overarching narrative elements

### Procedure
1. Implement each context handling strategy
2. For each strategy, run all benchmark tasks across different document lengths
3. Measure:
   - Response quality (using established rubric)
   - Latency
   - Token usage
   - Implementation complexity
4. Document findings and trade-offs

### Variables
- **Independent Variables**: 
  - Context handling strategy
  - Document length
  - Task type

- **Dependent Variables**:
  - Response quality score (1-5)
  - Response latency (ms)
  - Token usage (input + output)
  - Implementation complexity score (1-5)

## Implementation Status

### Planned
- Develop implementation for each context handling strategy
- Create sample novel content of varying lengths
- Implement measurement framework for all metrics
- Design quality assessment rubric

### Next Steps
- Implement the context handling strategies
- Create sample content and benchmark tasks
- Develop evaluation framework

## Expected Results
We expect to find that:

1. Simple sliding windows will perform well for continuation but poorly for distant references
2. Hierarchical summarization will perform better for thematic elements but may lose details
3. Key information extraction will excel at character consistency but may miss plot nuances
4. Hybrid approaches will show the best overall performance but highest complexity
5. RAG approaches will excel at specific reference tasks but may have higher latency

## Anticipated Limitations
- Evaluation contains subjective elements in quality assessment
- Novel styles and genres may require different optimal strategies
- Implementation complexity may vary based on tech stack
- Strategies may perform differently with different model capabilities

## Appendices

### Initial Strategy Pseudocode

#### Simple Sliding Window
```javascript
function getContext(novelText, currentPosition, windowSize) {
  // Extract the most recent text within token limit
  return novelText.slice(
    Math.max(0, currentPosition - windowSize),
    currentPosition
  );
}
```

#### Hierarchical Summarization
```javascript
function getContext(novel, currentPosition, maxTokens) {
  const immediate = getImmediateContext(novel, currentPosition);
  let remainingTokens = maxTokens - countTokens(immediate);
  
  // Add summaries in priority order until token limit is reached
  const context = immediate;
  
  if (remainingTokens > 0) {
    const currentChapterSummary = summarizeChapter(novel.currentChapter);
    context = currentChapterSummary + "\n\n" + context;
    remainingTokens -= countTokens(currentChapterSummary);
  }
  
  if (remainingTokens > 0) {
    const novelSummary = summarizeNovel(novel);
    context = novelSummary + "\n\n" + context;
  }
  
  return context;
}
```

#### Key Information Extraction
```javascript
function getContext(novel, currentPosition, query, maxTokens) {
  const immediate = getImmediateContext(novel, currentPosition);
  let remainingTokens = maxTokens - countTokens(immediate);
  
  // Extract key elements
  const relevantCharacters = getRelevantCharacters(novel, query);
  const relevantPlotPoints = getRelevantPlotPoints(novel, query);
  
  // Combine based on available tokens
  let context = "";
  if (countTokens(relevantCharacters) <= remainingTokens) {
    context += relevantCharacters + "\n\n";
    remainingTokens -= countTokens(relevantCharacters);
  }
  
  if (countTokens(relevantPlotPoints) <= remainingTokens) {
    context += relevantPlotPoints + "\n\n";
  }
  
  context += immediate;
  return context;
}
```
