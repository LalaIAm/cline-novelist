# OpenAI Model Evaluation for Novel Writing

## Metadata
- **Experiment ID**: EXP-001
- **Date**: 4/13/2025
- **Researcher**: Novylist Team
- **Category**: API Integration
- **Status**: In Progress

## Objective
To evaluate and compare different OpenAI GPT models for novel writing assistance, determining the optimal model(s) based on quality, latency, cost, and token efficiency for various writing tasks.

## Background
Novylist requires AI assistance for creative writing, character development, and plot structuring. Different OpenAI models offer varying capabilities, response qualities, and costs. This experiment will establish baseline metrics to inform model selection for different features in the platform.

## Hypothesis
GPT-4 will provide significantly higher quality responses for creative writing tasks compared to GPT-3.5, but the performance difference may not justify the cost difference for all use cases. Certain assistance types may be adequately served by less powerful models.

## Methodology

### Environment Setup
- Node.js test environment with OpenAI API SDK
- Testing framework for consistent measurement
- Response quality scoring system (1-5 scale)
- Latency measurement tools
- Token counting utilities

### Test Data
A set of standardized test prompts across five categories:
1. Writing continuation (paragraph completion)
2. Character development suggestions
3. Plot hole identification
4. Dialogue enhancement
5. Scene description enrichment

Each category will have 5 different prompts of varying complexity.

### Procedure
1. Develop the test suite with standardized prompts
2. Implement measurement framework for latency, token usage, and cost
3. Create quality evaluation rubric
4. Run each prompt against multiple models:
   - GPT-4 (latest)
   - GPT-3.5-turbo (latest)
   - GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct
5. Collect 3 responses per prompt/model combination
6. Measure response times, token counts, and estimated costs
7. Evaluate response quality using the established rubric
8. Analyze results for quality-cost tradeoffs

### Variables
- **Independent Variables**: 
  - OpenAI model used
  - Prompt category
  - Prompt complexity

- **Dependent Variables**:
  - Response quality score (1-5)
  - Response latency (ms)
  - Token usage (input + output)
  - Cost per request

- **Controlled Variables**:
  - Prompt wording
  - Temperature setting (0.7)
  - Max tokens (1000)
  - Other model parameters

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- Test harness implementation in `openai-model-evaluation.js`
- Standardized prompt templates for all 5 test categories:
  - Writing continuation
  - Character development
  - Plot hole identification
  - Dialogue enhancement
  - Scene description
- Test prompt creation for each category
- Response measurement system for latency, token usage, and cost
- Results storage and summary generation

### Next Steps
- Obtain OpenAI API key for testing
- Execute evaluation across all models
- Document response quality assessment methodology
- Perform the evaluation
- Document findings and analysis

## Results
[Pending execution of the experiment]

### Quantitative Data
| Model | Category | Avg. Quality | Avg. Latency | Avg. Tokens | Avg. Cost |
|-------|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| GPT-4 | Writing  | TBD          | TBD          | TBD         | TBD       |
| ...   | ...      | TBD          | TBD          | TBD         | TBD       |

### Qualitative Assessment
[To be completed after experiment execution]

## Analysis
[To be completed after experiment execution]

### Expected Limitations
- Quality assessment contains subjective elements
- Real-world performance may vary with user-specific contexts
- API performance may fluctuate based on OpenAI's infrastructure load
- Limited prompt samples per category (currently one per category)
- Testing with shorter content snippets, whereas real novels would have more context

## Interim Observations
During implementation, several potential considerations were identified:

1. Prompt engineering significantly impacts response quality across model types
2. Different writing assistance categories may benefit from different models based on complexity
3. Token usage varies greatly by category, with complex tasks requiring more tokens
4. Trade-offs between quality and cost will be central to model selection

## Conclusions
[To be completed after experiment execution]

## Recommendations
[To be completed after experiment execution]

## Next Steps
1. Develop prompt optimization experiments based on findings
2. Test context handling approaches with the selected model(s)
3. Investigate fine-tuning possibilities for specific use cases
4. Design caching strategies optimized for the selected model(s)

### Code Samples
```javascript
// Sample test harness code
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");
const configuration = new Configuration({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

async function testModelResponse(model, prompt, temperature = 0.7, maxTokens = 1000) {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  try {
    const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({
      model: model,
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
      temperature: temperature,
      max_tokens: maxTokens,
    });
    
    const latency = Date.now() - startTime;
    const tokenUsage = {
      prompt: response.data.usage.prompt_tokens,
      completion: response.data.usage.completion_tokens,
      total: response.data.usage.total_tokens
    };
    
    return {
      success: true,
      content: response.data.choices[0].message.content,
      latency,
      tokenUsage,
      estimatedCost: calculateCost(model, tokenUsage)
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      success: false,
      error: error.message,
      latency: Date.now() - startTime
    };
  }
}

function calculateCost(model, tokenUsage) {
  const rates = {
    'gpt-4': { input: 0.03, output: 0.06 },
    'gpt-3.5-turbo': { input: 0.0015, output: 0.002 }
    // Add other models as needed
  };
  
  if (!rates[model]) return null;
  
  return (tokenUsage.prompt * rates[model].input + 
          tokenUsage.completion * rates[model].output) / 1000;
}
```
