## Directory Structure
- `/diagrams` - Architecture diagrams organized by C4 model levels
  - `/context` - System context diagrams
  - `/container` - Container-level diagrams
  - `/component` - Component-level diagrams
  - `/sequence` - Sequence diagrams for key flows
- `/api-contracts` - API specifications and documentation
- `/ai-api` - AI integration architecture and documentation
- `/database` - Database schema and query documentation
- `/security` - Security architecture and controls
- `/performance` - Performance optimization documentation (pending)
- `/deployment` - Deployment and DevOps documentation (pending)
- `/integration` - Integration patterns and specifications (pending)

## Documentation Standards
- Architecture diagrams follow the C4 model using Mermaid for in-line diagrams
- API contracts follow OpenAPI/Swagger specification principles
- Code examples follow project coding standards (JavaScript with ES6+ features)
- All documentation is version-controlled alongside code
- Documentation is updated alongside code changes
- Each document includes a title, description, and last updated date

## Key Integration Points
- OpenAI API integration for AI assistance features
- Quill.js integration for rich text editing
- MongoDB for data persistence
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Express.js for API implementation
- React for frontend components
- Redux for state management
- WebSockets for real-time collaboration (planned)

This architecture documentation will continue to evolve throughout the development process, providing a comprehensive reference for implementation decisions. The focus of Phase 1 documentation has been on AI integration architecture, database design, and core API contracts to support initial MVP development in Phase 2.
