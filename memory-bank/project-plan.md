# Pre.dev Master Plan for Novylist

## Project Overview
Novylist is an AI-enhanced web application to assist novelists from ideation to publishing. The platform provides guidance, real-time feedback, customizable AI profiles, and seamless navigation throughout the creative process. The technical stack includes ReactJS, Vite, Redux Toolkit NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, SocketIO, OpenAI API, GPT-4, Draftjs, and Quilljs.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Research and Design (Months 1-3)
1. **User Onboarding & Landing Page**
   - Convert user onboarding story into tasks:
     - Develop detailed wireframes and UI/UX prototypes using React with TailwindCSS.
     - Create technical architecture documentation including AI integration points and version control strategy.
   - **Dependencies**: Finalized UI/UX design.

2. **Authentication and Role Management**
   - Break down registration, MFA, and role-based access control into tasks:
     - Design user model in MongoDB with fields (email, username, hashedPassword, role).
     - Build RESTful APIs for registration, login, MFA verification (NodeJS/ExpressJS).
     - Implement role-based access control middleware. 
   - **API Contract**: Define JSON schemas for requests/responses.
   - **Dependencies**: Complete research documentation and wireframes.

### Phase 2: MVP Development (Months 4-8)
1. **Drafting and Outlining Modules**
   - **AI-Powered Writing Assistance**:
     - Develop backend endpoint (/api/ai/prompts) integrating OpenAI API with performance goal <500ms.
     - Create React components for displaying prompts in a distraction-free editor using Draftjs/Quilljs.
     - Implement version control logic (branching, history tracking) for drafts.
     - **Dependencies**: Finished authentication and initial database setup.

2. **Dynamic Plot and Character Management**
   - Convert user stories into atomic tasks:
     - Develop MongoDB schema extensions for chapters, scenes, and paragraphs with metadata.
     - Build interactive UI components (React) for managing plot, characters, and subplots. 
     - Integrate progress indicators (progress bars, roadmap button) with AI nudges.
     - **API Contract**: CRUD endpoints for narrative elements.

3. **AI Customization & Adaptive Nudges**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement tracking of writing metrics (word count, time per section, edit ratio).
     - Create adaptive nudging algorithm in NodeJS; reduce nudges if author progresses quickly, increase if stuck.
     - Develop a collapsible settings panel in React with tone/sensitivity sliders and genre-specific profile options.
     - **Dependencies**: Stable drafting modules and version control integration.

### Phase 3: Beta Feature Expansion (Months 9-12)
1. **Real-Time Collaboration**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Use SocketIO to build live collaboration features (concurrent editing, conflict resolution).
     - Implement WebSocket endpoints in the backend and integrate into existing React components.
     - Adopt observer design pattern for state updates in real time.
     - **API Contract**: Establish protocols for live updates and synchronization.

2. **Enhanced AI Features and Feedback Loops**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Enhance contextual writing assistance, sentiment analysis, and fact-checking endpoints.
     - Expand the AI module to include specialized NLP tasks and integrate with custom endpoints for narrative analysis.
     - Document performance optimizations and caching strategies for AI endpoints.
     - **Dependencies**: Completion of core MVP modules.

### Phase 4: Final Testing and Launch (Months 13+)
1. **Comprehensive QA and Performance Optimization**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Develop and execute unit tests (Jest/Mocha) for all functions, integration tests for APIs, and end-to-end tests with Cypress.
     - Conduct security audits, optimization tests, and accessibility validation (WCAG 2.1 AA standards).
     - Fine-tune performance issues: implement caching, lazy loading, and asset optimization.
     - **Dependencies**: Stable feature integration from Phases 1-3.

2. **Deployment and CI/CD**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions/other CI tools: include linting, unit/integration tests, and build/verifications.
     - Configure environment variables in .env files with placeholders.
     - Document migration strategies, rollback procedures and deploy to multi-region cloud infrastructure.
     - **Dependencies**: Final QA acceptance and performance benchmarks met.

## Technical Specifications

### Component and API Designs
- **Component Interfaces**:
  - Prop definitions include state variables (e.g., userPreferences, currentDraft) and callback functions (e.g., onSubmit, onChange).

- **Inter-Component Communication**:
  - Use React Context API or Redux for centralized state management.
  - Components will communicate via clearly defined props and context providers.

- **API Contracts**:
  - Authentication: POST /api/auth/register, /login, /mfa.
  - AI Assistance: GET /api/ai/prompts with genre and user context parameters.
  - Narrative Data: CRUD endpoints for novels, chapters, and scenes.

### Data Schema and Database Design
- Define MongoDB models:
  - **User**: { _id, email, username, hashedPassword, role, createdAt, updatedAt }
  - **Novel**: { _id, userId, title, chapters: [{ title, scenes: [{ content, wordCount, revisionHistory }] }], versionHistory }
  - **Settings**: User-specific settings for AI tone, nudging frequency, and profile selection.

- **Indexing and Caching**:
  - Index commonly queried fields (e.g., userId for novels, chapter IDs).
  - Use in-memory caching (or Redis) for AI endpoints to meet performance thresholds.

### Error Handling and Logging
- **Error Categories**: 
  - Client errors (4xx), Server errors (5xx) with standardized JSON responses.
  - Use Winston or similar logger for centralized error logging.
- **Retry Policies**: 
  - Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient errors in API calls.

### Testing and QA Strategies
- **Unit Tests**: Ensure critical functions and components use Jest/React Testing Library.
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints, database interactions, and WebSocket connectivity.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Use Cypress to simulate full user flows from registration to collaborative writing.
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Monitor response times (under 500ms for AI endpoints) and simulate high-load scenarios.

### CI/CD and Deployment
- Configure pipelines to run on commits:
  - Linting, unit tests, integration tests, and deployment verification.
  - Use environment-specific configuration managed via .env files.
  - Ensure robust rollback procedures in case of deployment failure.

## Additional Considerations

- **Documentation and Developer Communication**:
  - Maintain detailed API docs and readme files for local setup.
  - Use internal wikis for architecture decisions and component designs.

- **Design Patterns Justification**:
  - Use Modular design for ease of maintenance and parallel development.
  - Decouple state management with React Context or Redux for a cleaner component hierarchy.
  - Observer pattern for real-time features to manage concurrent updates.

- **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
  - Set up monitoring for API performance, error rates, and usage analytics.
  - Define a plan for continuous post-launch maintenance with support for iterative improvements based on user feedback.

## Conclusion
This master plan outlines all phases of the development lifecycle for Novylist. By carefully structuring tasks, dependencies, and technical specifications, the development team can deliver an innovative, AI-enhanced novel writing platform that is robust, user-friendly, and scalable.
