# Editor Evaluation for Novylist

## Overview
This document tracks the evaluation process and findings for selecting between Draft.js and Quill.js as the rich text editor for Novylist. The decision is a critical technical choice that will impact the core writing experience throughout the application.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Performance with Large Documents**
   - Render time for large text blocks
   - Typing responsiveness
   - Memory usage patterns

2. **Customization and Extension**
   - API flexibility
   - Plugin ecosystem
   - Custom feature implementation 
   - Integration with our application architecture

3. **User Experience**
   - Default UI quality
   - Ease of use
   - Feature completeness
   - Content formatting options

4. **AI Integration Compatibility**
   - Ability to integrate with AI assistance features
   - Content access patterns for AI analysis
   - Support for injecting AI-generated content

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Touch support
   - Performance on mobile devices
   - UI adaptability on small screens

## Evaluation Process

The evaluation process consists of the following steps:

1. Initial implementation of both editors (completed)
2. Performance testing with large documents
3. Interaction latency measurements
4. Feature comparison
5. AI integration feasibility assessment
6. Mobile testing
7. Documentation of findings
8. Final selection and rationale

## Technical Implementation

An Editor Comparison technical spike has been implemented with the following components:

- `EditorComparisonPage.jsx`: Main page that allows toggling between editors
- `DraftEditor.jsx`: Draft.js implementation with basic formatting
- `QuillEditor.jsx`: Quill.js implementation with similar features
- `EditorEvaluationReport.jsx`: Component for documenting observations

The implementation includes performance measurement tools to quantitatively compare:
- Render times for large documents
- Interaction latency

## Current Findings

### Draft.js

**Strengths:**
- Deep integration with React
- Highly customizable content model
- Fine-grained control over rendering

**Challenges:**
- Requires more custom implementation
- Limited built-in features
- Steeper learning curve

### Quill.js

**Strengths:**
- Rich out-of-the-box functionality
- More mature formatting options
- Extensive documentation

**Challenges:**
- Less React-specific integration
- May have limitations for complex customizations

## Next Steps

1. Complete performance testing with standardized metrics
2. Assess integration with planned AI assistance features
3. Test mobile compatibility and responsiveness
4. Document final recommendations
5. Make selection decision before proceeding to UI/UX design phase

## Decision Timeline

The editor selection decision needs to be finalized by the end of Week 2 to allow the UI/UX design phase to proceed with a clear understanding of the editor capabilities and constraints.

## Impact on Project Timeline

Selecting the right editor is critical as it will:

1. Affect the core writing experience central to the application
2. Determine the approach for AI integration features
3. Influence the architecture of the document version control system
4. Impact mobile user experience

This document will be updated as the evaluation progresses with performance metrics, additional findings, and ultimately the final selection decision and rationale.
