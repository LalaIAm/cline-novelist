## Current Status

The project is in **Phase 1: Research and Design**, with parallel development tracks for editor integration, UI/UX design, and authentication system implementation. We have successfully:

1. **Quill.js Integration Track**:

   - Enhanced the QuillEditor component with novel-specific functionality
   - Implemented autosave, word count, and formatting features
   - Created utility functions for editor operations
   - Developed custom CSS for editor styling

2. **UI/UX Design Track**:
   - Established design tokens for consistent styling
   - Created wireframes for key interfaces:
     - Writing workspace with AI assistance panel
     - Dashboard with projects, analytics, and resources
     - Character Management interfaces with multiple views and detailed character information
     - Plot Management interfaces with timeline, structure, and scene organization views
     - Novel Settings & Configuration interfaces with metadata, preferences, export, and version history management
     - Onboarding Experience with multi-step registration and tutorial flow
     - User Profile with information management, statistics, preferences, and account settings
   - Developed reusable component library with core UI components
   - Created responsive design examples

3. **Authentication System Track**:
   - Implemented comprehensive User model with social auth support
   - Created secure authentication middleware and controllers
   - Developed frontend components for all authentication flows
   - Integrated Google and LinkedIn OAuth strategies
   - Implemented MFA support with multiple verification methods
   - Set up protected routes for authenticated content

The project has completed Phase 1's UI/UX design and wireframing milestone, as well as the authentication system implementation. The responsive wireframes, including the new writing workspace, are now in place. A comprehensive authentication system has been implemented with social login options, multi-factor authentication, and email verification. The next major focus will be on database schema design for novel-related models and technical architecture documentation.

## Known Issues

The following technical considerations have been identified and need to be addressed:

1. **NPM Package Installation**

   - Dependencies need to be installed before running the development server
   - The command `npm install` needs to be run in both the root and server directories

2. **Custom Quill Formats**

   - Implementation of custom formats for novel-specific elements (chapters, scenes, etc.)
   - These will require custom blots and module registration

3. **MongoDB Connection**

   - A MongoDB instance needs to be set up and properly configured
   - Environment variables need to be provided for database connection

4. **Character Relationship Visualization**

   - The relationship map requires a proper force-directed graph visualization library for production
   - Current implementation uses a simplified visualization for wireframe purposes

5. **Version History Implementation**

   - The version comparison tool will require a robust diff algorithm
   - Version branching will need a clear data model to maintain relationships between versions

6. **Responsive Design Implementation**
   - âœ… Responsive wireframes have been implemented for all features
   - âœ… Mobile-optimized interfaces with adaptive layouts
   - âœ… Panel switching for complex interfaces like the writing workspace
   - âœ… Simplified mobile visualizations for relationship maps and timelines
   - Production implementation will need performance optimization for mobile devices
