## Current Status
The project is in **Phase 1: Research and Design**, with parallel development tracks for editor integration and UI/UX design. We have successfully:

1. **Quill.js Integration Track**:
   - Enhanced the QuillEditor component with novel-specific functionality
   - Implemented autosave, word count, and formatting features
   - Created utility functions for editor operations
   - Developed custom CSS for editor styling

2. **UI/UX Wireframing Track**:
   - Established design tokens for consistent styling
   - Created wireframes for key interfaces:
     - Writing workspace with AI assistance panel
     - Dashboard with projects, analytics, and resources
     - **Character Management interfaces with multiple views and detailed character information**
     - **Plot Management interfaces with timeline, structure, and scene organization views**
   - Designed responsive layouts for core screens

The project is now in Weeks 3-5 of Phase 1, focused on completing remaining UI/UX wireframes with Novel Settings & Configuration as the next priority, followed by preparing for authentication system implementation.

## Known Issues
The following technical considerations have been identified and need to be addressed:

1. **NPM Package Installation**
   - Dependencies need to be installed before running the development server
   - The command `npm install` needs to be run in both the root and server directories

2. **Custom Quill Formats**
   - Implementation of custom formats for novel-specific elements (chapters, scenes, etc.)
   - These will require custom blots and module registration

3. **MongoDB Connection**
   - A MongoDB instance needs to be set up and properly configured
   - Environment variables need to be provided for database connection

4. **Character Relationship Visualization**
   - The relationship map requires a proper force-directed graph visualization library for production
   - Current implementation uses a simplified visualization for wireframe purposes

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Technical Stack Decisions
| Decision Point | Initial Consideration | Final Decision | Rationale |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Frontend Framework | React vs. Vue vs. Angular | React with Vite | Better ecosystem for the needed UI components, faster development with Vite |
| State Management | Redux vs. Context API vs. MobX | Redux Toolkit | Need for predictable state management across complex UI |
| Backend Framework | Express vs. NestJS vs. Fastify | Express.js | Simplicity, flexibility, and wide adoption |
| Database | MongoDB vs. PostgreSQL | MongoDB | Document-based structure fits narrative content model |
| Editor | Draftjs vs. Quilljs | Quilljs | Better feature completeness and development experience |

### Feature Prioritization Evolution
1. Initial focus on core writing experience with enhanced editor
2. Parallel development of UI/UX design to guide implementation
3. Character Management wireframes developed as first core narrative management feature
4. Plot Management wireframes planned as next major wireframing milestone
5. AI integration planned as integration points in the editor
6. Version control system to be developed for draft management
7. Real-time collaboration features moved to Phase 3 to prioritize single-user experience first
