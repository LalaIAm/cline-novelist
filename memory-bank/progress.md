# Progress Report for Novylist

## What Works
As Novylist is in the initial phases of development, the following elements are now in place:
- Memory Bank documentation structure established
- Project requirements and goals defined in projectbrief.md
- System architecture and patterns documented
- Technical stack selection completed
- Development environment setup completed:
  - Git repository initialized
  - Frontend structure with React, Vite, Redux, TailwindCSS set up
  - Backend structure with Express, MongoDB, JWT configured
  - Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier) configured
  - Editor technical spike implementation (Draft.js and Quill.js)

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Research and Design
- [x] Development environment setup (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] User onboarding and landing page wireframes (Weeks 3-5)
- [ ] Authentication system design and implementation (Weeks 6-8)
- [ ] Database schema design (Weeks 6-8)
- [ ] Technical architecture documentation (Weeks 11-12)
- [ ] UI/UX prototypes (Weeks 3-5)
- [ ] AI integration research (Weeks 11-12)

### Phase 2: MVP Development
- [ ] AI-powered writing assistance integration
- [ ] Drafting and outlining module
- [ ] Version control for drafts
- [ ] Dynamic plot and character management
- [ ] Adaptive nudging system

### Phase 3: Beta Feature Expansion
- [ ] Real-time collaboration features
- [ ] Enhanced AI integration and feedback loops
- [ ] Advanced narrative analysis tools

### Phase 4: Final Testing and Launch
- [ ] Comprehensive QA and performance optimization
- [ ] Deployment pipeline setup
- [ ] User documentation and tutorials

## Current Status
The project is in **Phase 1: Research and Design**, with the development environment setup now complete. We have successfully:
- Established the frontend structure with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS
- Set up the backend structure with Express and MongoDB
- Implemented authentication middleware and user models
- Created editor comparison page for technical spike (Draft.js vs. Quill.js)
- Configured development tools and environment templates

The next steps involve proceeding with UI/UX design and wireframing (Weeks 3-5), followed by the authentication system and database design implementation (Weeks 6-8).

## Known Issues
The following technical considerations have been identified and need to be addressed:

1. **NPM Package Installation**
   - Dependencies need to be installed before running the development server
   - The command `npm install` needs to be run in both the root and server directories

2. **Editor Selection Decision Pending**
   - The technical spike for Draft.js vs. Quill.js needs further testing and evaluation
   - Performance with large documents needs comprehensive testing
   - AI integration compatibility needs to be assessed for both editors

3. **MongoDB Connection**
   - A MongoDB instance needs to be set up and properly configured
   - Environment variables need to be provided for database connection

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Technical Stack Decisions
| Decision Point | Initial Consideration | Final Decision | Rationale |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Frontend Framework | React vs. Vue vs. Angular | React with Vite | Better ecosystem for the needed UI components, faster development with Vite |
| State Management | Redux vs. Context API vs. MobX | Redux Toolkit | Need for predictable state management across complex UI |
| Backend Framework | Express vs. NestJS vs. Fastify | Express.js | Simplicity, flexibility, and wide adoption |
| Database | MongoDB vs. PostgreSQL | MongoDB | Document-based structure fits narrative content model |
| Editor | Draftjs vs. Quilljs | Both being evaluated | Need to assess performance with long documents |

### Feature Prioritization Evolution
1. Initial focus on core writing experience before adding advanced features
2. AI integration planned early to build foundation for assistance features
3. Version control system identified as critical infrastructure component
4. Real-time collaboration features moved to Phase 3 to prioritize single-user experience first

## Milestone Timeline Status
| Milestone | Original Target | Current Status | Notes |
