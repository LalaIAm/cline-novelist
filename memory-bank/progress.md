## Known Issues

The following technical considerations have been identified and need to be addressed:

1. **NPM Package Installation**

   - Dependencies need to be installed before running the development server
   - The command `npm install` needs to be run in both the root and server directories

2. **Custom Quill Formats**

   - Implementation of custom formats for novel-specific elements (chapters, scenes, etc.)
   - These will require custom blots and module registration

3. **MongoDB Connection**

   - A MongoDB instance needs to be set up and properly configured
   - Environment variables need to be provided for database connection

4. **Character Relationship Visualization**

   - The relationship map requires a proper force-directed graph visualization library for production
   - Current implementation uses a simplified visualization for wireframe purposes

5. **Version History Implementation**

   - The version comparison tool will require a robust diff algorithm
   - Version branching will need a clear data model to maintain relationships between versions

6. **Responsive Design Implementation**
   - ✅ Responsive wireframes have been implemented for all features
   - ✅ Mobile-optimized interfaces with adaptive layouts
   - ✅ Panel switching for complex interfaces like the writing workspace
   - ✅ Simplified mobile visualizations for relationship maps and timelines
   - Production implementation will need performance optimization for mobile devices

7. **AI Integration**
   - ✅ The OpenAI API has rate limits - Implemented rate limiting system with tiered usage limits
   - ✅ GPT-4 latency (~18s) exceeds interactive feature targets - Implemented tiered model approach and caching
   - ✅ Token counting for context window management - Implemented token budget allocation system
   - ✅ Context handling for long-form content - Implemented comprehensive context handling system
   - ✅ Caching system - Implemented with memory and persistent storage options 
   - Test integration with Quill editor component
