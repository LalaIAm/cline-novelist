- Shared component library for reusable UI elements
- Utility functions grouped by purpose (editor, AI, formatting)
- Design tokens organized by type (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)
- Wireframe components organized by feature area

### Development Workflow

- Parallel development on editor and UI aspects
- Component-first approach to interface design
- Utility functions for common operations
- Design system to enforce consistency
- Component library development for reusable UI elements
- Wireframe implementation before functional components

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Quill.js provides good extensibility for novel-specific formatting
- Custom formats will require module registration and custom handlers
- Design system is essential for maintaining consistency across screens
- Component library helps enforce design patterns and reduces duplication
- Wireframes help visualize the complete user experience before implementation
- Parallel development tracks allow efficient progress on multiple fronts
- AI integration requires specific interface points in the editor
- Character management interface needs to balance comprehensive data with usability
- Relationship visualization requires specialized graph-based approaches
- Character arc tracking benefits from timeline-based visualization
- Version history visualization benefits from both chronological and list-based approaches
- Settings interfaces require clear organization to avoid overwhelming users
- Export options need to balance comprehensive control with simplicity
- Collaboration features need clear permission models and role definitions
- Onboarding flow should be comprehensive but not overwhelming
- User profile should provide both essential information and advanced customization
- Writing statistics can serve as motivation and progress tracking
- Progressive disclosure is important for complex interfaces
- Responsive design requires careful planning for complex visualizations

This active context document will continue to be updated as development progresses, tracking both the Quill.js integration and UI/UX design tracks.
