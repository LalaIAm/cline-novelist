# Active Context for Novylist

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on Phase 1: Research and Design, specifically the UI/UX wireframing for key interfaces, as outlined in the phase plan. We're working on two parallel tracks:

1. **Quill.js Integration Track**
   - Enhancing the QuillEditor component with novel-specific functionality
   - Implementing autosave, word count, and other writing-focused features
   - Creating utility functions for editor interactions and content management
   - Developing custom formatting options for novel elements (chapters, scenes, etc.)

2. **UI/UX Wireframing Track**
   - Establishing design tokens and a consistent design system
   - Creating wireframes for key application interfaces
   - Designing the main writing workspace with AI assistance panel
   - Developing dashboard and navigation components
   - **Implementing character management wireframes** (recently completed)

## Recent Changes
- Created Git branches for parallel development:
  - `quill-integration` for editor-specific development
  - `ui-wireframes` for design system and interface wireframes
- Enhanced the QuillEditor component with:
  - Extended configuration options for novel writing
  - Word and character counting functionality
  - Autosave capabilities with timestamp tracking
  - Focus state handling for better user experience
  - Custom toolbar with novel-specific formatting options
  - Custom CSS for editor styling
- Created utility functions for Quill editor:
  - Content statistics extraction
  - Local storage persistence with versioning
  - Novel-specific formatting helpers
  - AI integration utilities
- Developed design system foundations:
  - Comprehensive color palette with semantic colors
  - Typography system with novel-specific considerations
  - Spacing, borders, shadows, and other design tokens
- Created wireframe components:
  - WritingWorkspaceWireframe with editor, navigation, and AI panel
  - DashboardWireframe with projects, analytics, and resources
- **Implemented Character Management wireframes**:
  - Character Dashboard with list, gallery, and relationship views
  - Character Detail page with profile, relationships, development arc, appearances, notes, and AI suggestions
  - Comprehensive visualization of character attributes and relationships
  - AI integration points for character development assistance

## Next Steps
1. **Quill.js Integration**
   - Implement custom Quill formats for narrative elements
   - Create the module registration system for novel-specific formats
   - Develop version control interface for draft history
   - Finalize AI interaction points in the editor

2. **UI/UX Design and Wireframing**
   - Implement Novel Settings & Configuration wireframes
   - Create Novel Settings & Configuration wireframes
     - Project metadata management
     - Configuration interfaces
     - Export options
     - Version history visualization
   - Develop Onboarding Experience and User Profile wireframes
   - Create component library with reusable UI elements
   - Develop responsive variations for mobile and tablet views
   - Finalize the information architecture

3. **Prepare for Authentication Implementation**
   - Begin research on authentication flows and security requirements
   - Plan user profile and settings schema
   - Research email verification system options

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Character Management Implementation
- Created comprehensive wireframes for character management functionality
- Implemented multiple views (list, gallery, relationship map) for flexible management
- Designed detailed character profiles with physical attributes, personality traits, background, and skills
- Added character development arc tracking for managing character growth
- Created visualization for character appearances throughout the narrative
- Integrated AI assistance suggestions for character development
- Designed relationship management with various relationship types and strengths

### Plot Management Implementation
- Created comprehensive wireframes for plot management functionality
- Implemented multiple visualization methods for plot structure:
  - Timeline view for chronological visualization of plot elements
  - Structure view based on three-act structure with narrative beats
  - Scene organization view for managing individual scenes
- Designed plot element detail interface with description, notes, and character relationships
- Created filtering and categorization systems for plot elements by type and impact
- Integrated scene tracking with status indicators (completed, draft, outline, etc.)
- Connected plot elements to characters to visualize narrative relationships
- Added AI assistance suggestions for plot development and consistency

### UI/UX Design Approach
- Created consistent design tokens based on TailwindCSS
- Developed wireframes that showcase core functionality
- Emphasized clean, focused interfaces for distraction-free writing
- Designed mobile-responsive layouts for key screens
- Incorporated AI assistance panels throughout the experience

### Implementation Priorities
- Focus on core writing experience with the enhanced Quill editor
- Develop wireframes to guide implementation of key interfaces
- Ensure design system allows for consistent styling across the application
- Prepare for integration of AI features in the writing workflow

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Established
- Feature-based branch organization with separate tracks
- Component-based structure for React elements
- Utility functions grouped by purpose (editor, AI, formatting)
- Design tokens organized by type (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)

### Development Workflow
- Parallel development on editor and UI aspects
- Component-first approach to interface design
- Utility functions for common operations
- Design system to enforce consistency

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Quill.js provides good extensibility for novel-specific formatting
- Custom formats will require module registration and custom handlers
- Design system is essential for maintaining consistency across screens
- Wireframes help visualize the complete user experience before implementation
- Parallel development tracks allow efficient progress on multiple fronts
- AI integration requires specific interface points in the editor
- Character management interface needs to balance comprehensive data with usability
- Relationship visualization requires specialized graph-based approaches
- Character arc tracking benefits from timeline-based visualization

This active context document will continue to be updated as development progresses, tracking both the Quill.js integration and UI/UX wireframing tracks.
