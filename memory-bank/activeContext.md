# Active Context for Novylist

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on Phase 1: Research and Design, specifically the development environment setup as outlined in Weeks 1-2 of the phase plan:
- Establishing the project structure with React/Vite frontend and Node/Express backend
- Implementing the technical spike for editor evaluation (Draft.js vs. Quill.js)
- Configuring essential tools and libraries (ESLint, Prettier, TailwindCSS, Redux)
- Setting up authentication foundation and database models

## Recent Changes
- Initialized Git repository for version control
- Created comprehensive frontend structure with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS
- Set up backend structure with Express, MongoDB configuration
- Implemented User model with authentication capabilities
- Created editor comparison page for Draft.js and Quill.js evaluation
- Added configuration files for development tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Created environment configuration templates for both frontend and backend

## Next Steps
1. **Editor Evaluation Completion**
   - Complete the technical spike by testing both editors with large documents
   - Document findings and make recommendation for final selection
   - Finalize the integration strategy for the selected editor

2. **Proceed to UI/UX Design and Wireframing (Weeks 3-5)**
   - Begin user journey mapping for primary personas
   - Create wireframes for key pages (landing, dashboard, editor)
   - Establish design system foundations and component library

3. **Prepare for Authentication Implementation (Weeks 6-8)**
   - Continue developing authentication flows
   - Finalize user profile and settings schema
   - Set up email verification system

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Editor Selection Considerations
- Draft.js provides more granular control but requires more custom implementation
- Quill.js offers more out-of-box functionality but may have limitations for complex customizations
- Performance with large documents is a critical factor being evaluated
- Need to assess extensibility for AI suggestion integration
- Mobile support considerations for both editors

### Technical Decisions
- Using JWT for authentication with provisions for MFA implementation
- MongoDB document model designed to support complex narrative structures
- Frontend state management using Redux Toolkit for predictable state flow
- TailwindCSS configured with custom theme for consistent styling
- Environment configuration separated for development and production environments

### Implementation Priorities
- Focus on establishing solid development foundation before adding complex features
- Documentation of setup and architecture for team collaboration
- Code quality with linting and formatting configurations
- Preparing for the next phases with modular, extensible architecture

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Established
- Clear separation between frontend and backend code
- Component-based structure for React elements
- Feature-based organization for backend controllers and routes
- Consistent use of JavaScript with JSDoc comments for documentation

### Development Workflow
- Git-based workflow with feature branches (to be fully implemented)
- Environment configuration using .env files with templates
- Code quality enforcement through ESLint and Prettier
- Modular architecture for extensibility

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Development environment setup is critical for team efficiency and project scalability
- Technical spikes for editor evaluation will help make informed decisions for core writing experience
- MongoDB schema design requires careful planning for complex narrative structures
- Authentication system needs to be comprehensive yet flexible for future MFA implementations
- React/Redux architecture provides good separation of concerns for complex UI interactions

This active context document will continue to be updated as Phase 1 progresses, with particular focus on the UI/UX design process in the coming weeks.
