   - Create sequence diagrams for key user flows
   - Begin deployment architecture documentation

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies

- OpenAI API access for experiments
- Understanding of MongoDB schema design for database architecture
- Quill.js documentation for editor integration patterns

### Risks

- OpenAI API limitations or rate limits affecting experiments
- Complex context handling for novel-length documents
- Meeting the 500ms performance target for interactive features
- Integration complexity with Quill.js editor

## Success Criteria

The AI Integration Research and Technical Architecture Documentation phase will be considered complete when:

1. All planned experiments are conducted and findings documented
2. A comprehensive AI integration strategy document is created
3. Prompt engineering guidelines are established
4. Working prototypes for key AI features are implemented
5. All architectural diagrams are completed
6. API contracts for all endpoints are documented
7. Database schema architecture is fully specified
8. Security, performance, and deployment architectures are documented

## Conclusion

The AI Integration Research and Technical Architecture Documentation efforts are progressing well. We have successfully evaluated different OpenAI models for novel writing assistance, documented our findings, implemented a caching system for performance optimization, and enhanced our writing continuation prototype with caching. The model evaluation results have provided clear guidance for our tiered model approach, where GPT-3.5-turbo will be used for standard features requiring fast responses and GPT-4 for premium features requiring higher quality. Our caching implementation demonstrates significant performance improvements, reducing response times from seconds to milliseconds for cached responses.

Our focus now is on implementing context handling strategies for long-form content, creating additional AI feature prototypes, and completing the technical architecture documentation to prepare for Phase 2 MVP development.

This document will be updated regularly as research progresses and architectural decisions are made.
