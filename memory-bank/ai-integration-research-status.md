# AI Integration Research and Technical Architecture Documentation Status

**Date**: 4/13/2025  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Created By**: Novylist Team  

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of the AI Integration Research and Technical Architecture Documentation tasks required to complete Phase 1 of Novylist development. These efforts will establish the foundation for implementing AI-assisted writing features in Phase 2.

## Current Progress

### Project Structure Setup

- [x] Created Git branch `ai-research` for AI integration research
- [x] Established directory structure for research documentation
- [x] Set up directory structure for architecture documentation
- [x] Created templates for experiments and prompt engineering
- [x] Prepared diagram organization using C4 model approach

### AI Integration Research

- [x] Created research plan with 8 key focus areas
- [x] Defined experiment methodology template
- [x] Prepared first experiment (EXP-001) for OpenAI model evaluation
- [x] Created prompt template structure for documenting prompt patterns
- [x] Prepared first prompt template (PT-001) for writing continuation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Week 1: Days 2-3)

1. **AI Research**:
   - Begin OpenAI API evaluation experiment
   - Document findings from initial API testing
   - Create test suite for measuring response quality and performance
   - Draft context handling strategies document

2. **Architecture Documentation**:
   - Create container diagram showing main system components
   - Document database schema architecture
   - Begin API contract documentation for core novel management endpoints
   - Create sequence diagram for AI assistance flow

### Short-Term Tasks (Week 1: Days 4-7)

1. **AI Research**:
   - Complete initial API evaluation
   - Begin context handling experiments
   - Create prototype for writing continuation feature
   - Document token optimization techniques

2. **Architecture Documentation**:
   - Complete component diagrams for AI integration
   - Document security architecture
   - Create sequence diagrams for key user flows
   - Begin deployment architecture documentation

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies

- OpenAI API access for experiments
- Understanding of MongoDB schema design for database architecture
- Quill.js documentation for editor integration patterns

### Risks

- OpenAI API limitations or rate limits affecting experiments
- Complex context handling for novel-length documents
- Meeting the 500ms performance target for interactive features
- Integration complexity with Quill.js editor

## Success Criteria

The AI Integration Research and Technical Architecture Documentation phase will be considered complete when:

1. All planned experiments are conducted and findings documented
2. A comprehensive AI integration strategy document is created
3. Prompt engineering guidelines are established
4. Working prototypes for key AI features are implemented
5. All architectural diagrams are completed
6. API contracts for all endpoints are documented
7. Database schema architecture is fully specified
8. Security, performance, and deployment architectures are documented

## Conclusion

The AI Integration Research and Technical Architecture Documentation efforts are well underway, with initial structure and templates established. The focus now shifts to conducting experiments, creating prototypes, and completing the architectural documentation required to finish Phase 1 and prepare for Phase 2 MVP development.

This document will be updated regularly as research progresses and architectural decisions are made.
