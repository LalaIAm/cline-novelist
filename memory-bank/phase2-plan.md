## Technical Implementation Details

### Provider-Agnostic AI Architecture

The provider-agnostic AI architecture will consist of the following key components:

1. **AI Service Abstraction Layer**:
   - Create a provider-agnostic interface that standardizes AI interactions
   - Implement consistent response formats regardless of provider
   - Handle provider-specific error management centrally

2. **Provider Adapters**:
   - Develop specific adapters for each AI provider (OpenAI, Google Vertex AI)
   - Map standardized parameters to provider-specific formats
   - Implement provider-specific authentication and rate limiting

3. **Prompt Management System**:
   - Design prompts that work effectively across different models
   - Implement provider-specific prompt optimization when needed
   - Create a template system that can be tailored per provider

4. **Response Normalization**:
   - Standardize outputs from different providers into consistent formats
   - Implement quality normalization to ensure consistent user experience
   - Create fallback mechanisms if one provider returns low-quality results

5. **Provider Selection Strategy**:
   - Create rules for dynamic provider selection based on feature, cost, or user preference
   - Implement A/B testing capability to compare provider performance
   - Add configuration options for default providers per feature

### Context Handling Architecture

The context handling system will provide sophisticated context management for novel-length content:

1. **Segmentation Engine**:
   - Break novel content into manageable segments
   - Identify logical divisions in the narrative
   - Maintain content relationships between segments

2. **Windowing System**:
   - Create sliding window of immediate context
   - Adjust window size based on token limits
   - Prioritize recent/relevant content

3. **Summarization Engine**:
   - Generate multi-level summaries of content
   - Create hierarchical summarization (chapter, novel)
   - Balance detail and brevity based on available token budget

4. **Embedding Service**:
   - Generate embeddings for content segments
   - Index embeddings for similarity search
   - Update embeddings when content changes

5. **Similarity Search**:
   - Find relevant content based on current writing context
   - Retrieve content from across the entire novel
   - Balance relevance and recency in results

6. **Token Budget Manager**:
   - Allocate tokens between different context components
   - Adapt to different provider token limits
   - Optimize token usage for best response quality

### Continuation Feature Data Flow

The writing continuation feature will follow this process flow:

1. User requests continuation in the editor
2. System collects current context from the document
3. Context handler checks cache for similar requests
4. If cache hit, return cached response
5. If cache miss:
   - Context handler assembles optimal context
   - Prompt service generates appropriate prompt
   - Provider selector chooses optimal AI provider
   - Provider adapter formats request for chosen provider
   - Response is streamed back to editor as it's generated
   - Response is cached for future similar requests
6. User reviews and accepts/rejects suggestions

### Database Implementation

#### AI Provider Models

```javascript
// Provider Configuration Model
{
  id: ObjectId,
  name: String,           // "openai" or "vertex"
  isActive: Boolean,

  },
  rateLimit: {
    requestsPerMinute: Number,
    tokensPerDay: Number
  },

      contextWindow: Number,  // Max tokens
      costPerToken: Number,
      isDefault: Boolean
    }
  ],
  features: {
    writingContinuation: String, // Default model for this feature
    characterDevelopment: String,
    plotAnalysis: String,
    // etc.
  }
}

// User AI Preferences Model (embedded in user settings)
{
  preferredProvider: String,  // Default provider
  featurePreferences: {
    writingContinuation: {
      provider: String,
      model: String
    },
    // Other feature preferences
  },
  usageStats: {
    tokensUsed: Number,
    requestCount: Number,
    lastReset: Date
  },
  // Other preferences like temperature, response length, etc.
